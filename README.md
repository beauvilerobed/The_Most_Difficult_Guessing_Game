# Rules

You will get to choose the number of attempts which will corresponds to the number of attempts you have for **EACH** letter of a given word.

**RULE1**: 

If you repeat a letter that is not the correct letter (e.g. **r r**) then that is an attempt.


**RULE2**: 

If you repeat a letter more than three times or you have two non-consecutive letters which were already used 

(e.g.  **a b b b**  or  **k b e d c k**   ) then GAME OVER.
      
Also, there is a *hint mode* and a *non-hint mode* in case you're feeling confident!
       
The guessing starts when you pick a letter.                      
   
## Good luck!
